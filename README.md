# Real-estate-price-exploration

This project is to collect data from real estate selling website and then use machine learning models to analyse the data.   
I wrote two Python scripts: 
* crawler is to scrape properties selling related infomation. 
* data_clean_analyse is to cleanse the data and build machine learning model to investigate what is the key factores that influence the property selling price.
